A bot that finds solution for <b>Sokoban Game</b> in least moves possible, or states that its not possible. <br>
Doesnt require any extra Libraries, uses BFS algorithm to find in least possible moves. <br> 
Can handle up to 30x30 grids, but unless the puzzle has few paths this will take an <b>unholy</b> amount of time and likely result in stack overflow error <br>
